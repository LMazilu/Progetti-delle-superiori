All around me are familiar faces
Children waiting for the day they feel good
Worn out places, worn out faces
Happy birthday, happy birthday
Bright and early for their daily races
Made to feel the way that every child should
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Their tears are filling up their glasses
Went to school and I was very nervous
No expression, no expression
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hide my head I want to drown my sorrow
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
No tomorrow, no tomorrow
Look right through me, look right through me
And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad
And I find it kinda funny, I find it kinda sad
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
The dreams in which I'm dying are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
I find it hard to tell you, I find it hard to take
When people run in circles it's a very very
When people run in circles it's a very very
mad world mad world
Mad world, world
Enlarge your world
Mad world
